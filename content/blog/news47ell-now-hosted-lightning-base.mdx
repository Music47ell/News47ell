I'm really happy to say that News47ell is now hosted with none other than [Lightning Base.][1] A special thanks to [Chris Piepho][2] the founder of Lightning Base for his tremendous help through this entire process.
I contacted Chris about a week ago and told him how my site was having multiple outages a day, 62 outages and total of 19 hours of downtime in one month.

I wanted a new host that offers [PHP 7][3], [HTTP/2][4] and [Staging site][5], and most importantly for my site to NOT suffer any more downtime.

Chris responded right away and said that all of these things can be achieved easily, so I signed up and I dove inside the [CPanel][6] which I'm not familiar with, but it wasn't that hard to learn.

The site has been on [Lightning Base][1] host for the past few days now and things are running smoothly.

Yesterday, with the help of Chris, News47ell support [HTTP/2][7], which you can learn more about its benefit [here][8], and see a demo about it from Akamai [here][9].
