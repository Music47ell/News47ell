Patrick Welker talking about the new Mr. Reader icon:

> The goal was to carry the spirit of Mr. Reader to the new OS. So the icon needed to feel lighter and right at home on iOS 7.

After publishing [my review of Mr. Reader](https://www.news47ell.com/reviews/mr-reader-review) i thought its the perfect time to make a post about this great article by Patrick.

You don't know this, but I've read this article more than 5 times just because it's this good.

The App icon is a part of my homescreen, it should always be something good to look at, and when an app have an ugly icon, then it doesn't deserve a spot on my homescreen.

[Oliver](https://twitter.com/curioustimes) made sure that the app would stay on my homescreen because of how great the app is, and [Patrick](https://twitter.com/_patrickwelker) did the same thing by making the icon look so good.
