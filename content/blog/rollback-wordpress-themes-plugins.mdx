Has this ever happened to you? Having [enabled WordPress automatic updates][1] and the developer of your [favorite WordPress theme][2] pushed an update with a code that changed something in the theme that you weren't ready for. So, therefore, you needed to rollback to a previous version of that same theme but you didn't know how and when you learned how to do it, you found the steps too cumbersome?

This never happened to me but it could've happened to you. It could happen to any one of us and when it does, you should be ready to quickly rollback to any version you want of your favorite theme or plugin.

If you’re looking for an easy way to rollback your favorite WordPress theme or plugin to any previous version that your heart desires, then there's a solution for you and it's called [WP Rollback Plugin][3].

Today I will share with you How to Roll Back WordPress Themes and Plugins using WP Rollback plugin.

Usually, rolling back to a previous version of a plugin/theme required you to SFTP into your website and then visit the plugin/theme WordPress.org page. You click on advanced view, scroll to the bottom, select the version you want, download it, upload it, go back to your site and then re-activate the plugin.

Writing those by itself is too much, let alone actually doing it. So why not take advantage of the WP Rollback WordPress plugin which will allow you to do the same thing but with fewer steps.

How to Download Older Version of WordPress Plugin with [WP Rollback][3] to any previous or newer version.

### Step 1

Go to Plugins > Add New

### Step 2

Search for WP Rollback > Install > Activate

### Step 3

Go to Plugins > Installed Plugins and hover over the plugin you want to Rollback then click on Rollback.

### Step 4

Select which previous or newer version you want, click on 'View Changelog' to view the release note of the version of which you want to rollback to, then click Rollback.

### Step 5

This is the final message which also contains a warning message telling you to have a backup of your site in case something happened to your site. Once you’re ready, click Rollback and the previous or newer version of the plugin or theme which you selected to install will be downloaded, installed and activated just like when you installed this plugin or any other plugin.

That's pretty much it for rolling back a plugin. As for themes, it works pretty much the same way.

Just go to Appearance > Themes > Click on your theme and then Rollback.

## Conclusion

Doing this is better than downloading the files from the WordPress repo because you're doing all these steps from your WordPress dashboard. Or as people say, from the comfort of your own home. This is much simpler instead of having to use an FTP app, download files, unzip them, upload them and reactivate the plugin again.

With WP Rollback, all you have to do is download the plugin and follow the steps above and you should be good to go.
