Almost all web developers out there who use Dropbox as their backup solution for their NodeJS projects suffer from the fact that Dropbox has no option to ignore the humongous dependency directory, node_modules.

A node_modules folder for a simple GatsbyJS website is 206MB in size with 39,203 items in it, so imagine how long that takes to sync and imagine a developer who have multiple NodeJS projects that syncs with Dropbox.

In this tutorial, you'll find a solution to this issue that will prevent the node-Modules directory from getting synced to your Dropbox account.

The script that I will discuss with you today takes advantage of /rsync/, a utility written in C that allows you to transfer and synchronize your files easily between folders, external hard-disks, machines and across a network.

This utility is free and easy to install.

Install rsync on macOS using Homebrew (For more info, visit [rsync's website](https://rsync.samba.org/)

``` shell
brew install rsync
```

Now, copy and paste the script below and save it in a file called ~project_backup.sh~

``` shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e # Exit on error

src_dir="$HOME/Projects/"
dest_dir="$HOME/Dropbox/Projects-Backup/"

# run rsync
rsync -ar --delete \
  --filter=':- .gitignore' \
  --exclude='node_modules' \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --exclude='.DS_Store' \
  --chmod='F-w' \
  "$src_dir" "$dest_dir"
```

Finally, to make the script executable, we need to execute the following command in our terminal:

``` shell
chmod +x project_backup.sh
```

And that's `src_dir` it. Now, let's take a step back and analyze the script above:

- `src_dir` Your project source directory.
- `dest_dir` Where you want the backup to be.
- `--delete` Delete files in `dest_dir` if they no longer exist in `src_dir`.
- `--filter=':- .gitignore'` Rsync will ignore all the files and directories listed in `.gitignore`.
- `--exclude` Extra files and folders that you want rsync to exclude.
- `--chmod='F-w'` Rsync will remove the writing permission on all the files that it copied to Dropbox.

Now that you have this neat and simple script
