It was June 6th, 2016, the day PayPal lost its license in Turkey. I've been searching for a solution that will allow my readers to be able to donate money every month in the form of a subscription.

Luckily, Patreon offers that with their reliable, trustworthy, and secure system. For international money transfers, that will be handled by Payoneer. A New York City based money transfer and digital payment services.

Your donation will go towards paying for the site's hosting provider to keep News47ell up and running and toward my coffee, to keep me up and running. Also, toward some crazy additions to the site in the future.

You can check the Patreon page and subscribe by clicking the button below or keep reading to learn more information.

I decided to go with two subscription models that have identical benefits because I wanted to use Patreon as a bridge between my readers and I, who would like to support me by subscribing.

You can choose between **$5/month** or **$10/month**

All readers will still see the exact high quality, in-depth reviews and the same interesting news which you all enjoy. That won't change.

But, for those who subscribe, they will get a few extra perks which you can read about below.

### Membership Benefits

In the beginning, there will be only a single benefit of becoming a member and supporting me through Patreon:

- **Patrons Hall of Fame**: Your name will be added to a special page here on the site to let everyone know that you've helped keep the site up and running.

Later, I have two more benefits planned so far when we reach the goal of $300:

- **Exclusive Giveaways**: Be part of future, exclusive giveaways.
- **Make your voice heard**: Get access to the site's Discord channel and to get a sneak peek at upcoming articles as well as being able to give feedback and suggestions.

Your support will help the site evolve, get bigger and become better while maintaining the same level of quality articles which you all love and enjoy.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Founder & Editor-in-Chief of News47ell.
