According to [WPBeginner][1] I'm Awesome, and maybe you are too, if your blog content has been scraped by another website.

#### The Story

That's what happened to me couple of days ago when i found out that one of my article has been copied/pasted to another website, completely, with my affiliate link, and my images from my server.

#### Feelings

I wasn't surprised to see that i didn't get any credit. ((except if you right click on an image and see its source then you will find my domain name.))

#### Reaction

This is the first time something like this happen to me, so i did what every other person would do in this case, i Googled what to do when someone is scraping your site, and i came across two articles:

- [Beginner's Guide to Preventing Blog Content Scraping in WordPress / WP Beginner][2]
- [Stop WordPress Content Thieves From Stealing Your Content - And Your Bandwidth / WPMU DEV][3]

  Both website does a very good job explaining why, when, and how this happen, so make sure to read them for more details on this matter.

#### Taking Actions

For me, i decided to do to nothing about this, i don't wanna file for DMCA or talk to the website or hosting provider, bcuz i feel like its A waste of my time, the only thing i did is using

[No Right Click Images Plugin][4], i think its great and useful in this case.

#### Future

I'm not sure, i might try other solutions, i might start using the other plugins mentioned in the article, this could happen today or tomorrow, but for now, i'm happy with how things are.
