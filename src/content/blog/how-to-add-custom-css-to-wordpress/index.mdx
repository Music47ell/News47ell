Today I will tell you How to Add Custom CSS to WordPress. Something I had to learn while redesigning this site. And I will tell you where you need to add your shiny new customs CSS.

WordPress themes already come with [style.css][1] file which you can add extra CSS to and change the old one, but when the theme receive an update, all the changes will be lost. You can use a [child theme's style.css][2] file and do @import but you shouldn't, and you need to [avoid it][3].

#### How to Add Custom CSS to WordPress

Jetpack have a [Custom CSS module][4] which comes with code revision, it's simple and works well. And last but not least, there's [Tom Usborne's Simple CSS Plugin][5] that include CSS editor in the Customizer so you can live preview your changes and Metabox for page/post specific CSS.

But I wanted more, I was really thirsty for a plugin with more features.

So I put my backpack and started my journey trying to find the perfect plugin in the land of repo, a land so far away, with a population of 46,074 plugins.

After spending days in this land, trying plugin after another, I finally found the perfect one, it has the basic feature, a place for your Custom CSS code, and a ton of extra features that you never think you need until you see them and try them yourself.

Here's my Simple Custom CSS and JS Review:

Developed by [SilkyPress][6], Simple Custom CSS and JS is the ultimate [WordPress plugin][7] for those of us who like to go crazy with their extra CSS & JS codes.

First things you need to know is that this plugin has two versions, FREE & PRO, Here's what they have to offer:

### FREE Version has the following features:

- Internal or External File linking type for CSS & JS.
- Placing your CSS & JS in Header or Footer.
- Add CSS & JS for both Front-end and Administrator Area.
- Add as many CSS & JS as you want.
- Enable or disable CSS & JS.

### Pro Version pricing starts at $58.50 and has the following features:

- LESS & SASS Preprocessors.
- Minify your CSS & JS code.

```css
.btn {
	display: inline-block;
	color: #f00;
	background-color: inherit;
	font-size: 20px;
	font-family: 'HelveticaNeue-Light', 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial,
		'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;
	font-weight: 500;
	text-transform: uppercase;
	text-align: center;
	text-decoration: none;
	padding: 0.5em 1em;
	border: 2px solid #f00;
	margin: 5px 0 auto;
}

.btn:hover {
	background-color: #f00;
	text-decoration: none;
	color: #fff;
}
```

And here's how the same code look when it's minified:

```css
.btn {
	display: inline-block;
	color: red;
	background-color: inherit;
	font-size: 20px;
	font-family: 'HelveticaNeue-Light', 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial,
		'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;
	font-weight: 500;
	text-transform: uppercase;
	text-align: center;
	text-decoration: none;
	padding: 0.5em 1em;
	border: 2px solid red;
	margin: 5px 0 auto;
}

.btn:hover {
	background-color: red;
	text-decoration: none;
	color: #fff;
}
```

Here's the final result:

Input: 509 bytes
Output: 393 bytes
Saved: 29.52%

Now imagine the same thing but for the CSS of your entire site, it will make a difference.

- Preview your CSS & JS before taking it live.
- Target your CSS & JS on specific URLs.
- Code Revision.

### Conclusion:

If you're super crazy about CSS, like to add multiple customs CSS & js to your site, make each page look different from the other and keep your site fast and smooth, then this plugin is a no brainier and you should get it right now.
