[Long ago][1], before the recent trending topic of Facebook and Telegram bots, there was a Twitter bot, a great one, called [Magic Recs][2] that used to send DMs when the people you follow, followed a viral account or favorite a viral tweet.

Sadly, Twitter scrapped this account few days ago [according to TechCruch][3] who confirmed this and received a statement from Twitter:

> "@MagicRecs is no longer regularly sending recommendations through Direct Message. Recommendations that were previously shared via Direct Message are now delivered via push notification," a spokesperson noted in a written statement.

What was once an exciting personal DM sent to people to tell them about an exciting new Twitter profile to follow, has now become a notification.

I followed Magic Recs on Apr 7, 2014, and my last DM was on Mar 29, 2016.
