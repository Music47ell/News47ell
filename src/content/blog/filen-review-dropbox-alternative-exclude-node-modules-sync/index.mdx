If you're a web developer, use npm packages, and like to back up your projects to Dropbox, then I'm sure you did the following Google search at some point:

_How can I exclude the `node_modules` directory from syncing in Dropbox?_

I've been using a custom bash script for few years now that uses rsync to copy folders from one place to a Dropbox folder and exclude certain files, folders, and everything in a `.gitignore` file.

This solution worked great but it meant that I had to have two copies of everything I needed to backup.

> Info: ICYMI, I recently wrote two articles about how to exclude node_modules from syncing during backup. The first one uses [rsync](/blog/sync-node-project-ignore-node-modules-rsync-bash-script) and the second one uses [Maestral](/blog/maestral-review-exclude-node-modules-dropbox-mignore-gitignore)

Well, with the introduction of [Filen]($filen), I don't have to worry about this anymore. Filen is a Dropbox alternative that allows you to exclude the `node_modules` folder from syncing and so much more.

## Introducing Filen: A Dropbox Alternative with Advanced Syncing Options

[Filen]($filen) is a zero knowledge end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that has all the features that you love and are used to from [Dropbox]($dropbox), as well as an easy-to-use interface, encryption for all your data in a German high-security data center, the ability to share files and pictures using a private link or with other Filen users, syncing your data across multiple devices, ability to backup your camera folder from your phone automatically and selective sync option as well.

All of this is cool but one `node_modules` folder can ruin all of this for a web developer.

For those of you who don't know, a `node_modules` folder contains all the necessary files to run a Node.js project. Like this website that uses Next.js. The problem with it is that it can be large and time-consuming to sync due to its size and frequent updates.

For example, the `node_modules` folder for this website is '632.9 MB' and it contains '48,363' files. That takes forever to sync and any update, removal, or installation of a new module means syncing again and again.

With [Filen]($filen), you don't have to worry about any of this. See, Filen has a neat feature that allows you to select files and folders to be ignored while syncing. Like a `.gitignore` file. They call it actually `.filenignore` file but in reality, it's not a file, it's a section in the app where you list the files and folders and it will do the rest.

Imagine having a Projects folder housing all your web development projects. By instructing Filen to sync the folder and selecting your [preferred sync option](https://filen.io/apps/desktop) (e.g., two-way, local to cloud, cloud to local, local backup, or cloud backup), you can then utilize the `.filenignore` option to exclude the `node_modules` folder from syncing.

Let Filen handle the synchronization while you focus on your development tasks, saving you time and ensuring a seamless experience.
