These are all the projects I've worked on.

## [News47ell.com](https://www.news47ell.com)

News47ell is a portfolio/blog that I started on 2013 and it's still running to this day. Currently, it's running on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
This is a place where I write about things that I'm interested in and do experiment with new technologies and ideas.

It started only as a blog that ran on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and was hosted on [LightningBase](https://www.news47ell.com/recommends/lightningbase). But, I wanted to learn something new, so first, I went with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted it on [Netlify](https://www.news47ell.com/recommends/netlify), then switched to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and now, I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build) and hosting it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
